# Comparative-Analysis-of-Mental-Health-Predictors
Evaluating demographics, behavioral and socioeconomic factors between Rural Community and University Population in Kilifi County to understand their influence on mental health conditions.

## Summary

This study was conducted in Kilifi County, situated along Kenyaâ€™s coast, was the primary study location. The county comprises six sub-counties: Kilifi North, Kilifi South, Ganze, Kaloleni, Malindi, and Magarini. Its population predominantly engages in informal labor, subsistence farming, and small-scale trade, with limited access to healthcare services.

Data were collected using structured surveys administered by **Community Health Workers (CHWs)**. The surveys were administered face-to-face for the rural population and electronically for university students, ensuring comprehensive coverage.

The aim of the study was to analyze and identify factors associated with mental health outcomes and compare differences and similarities in two distinct populations:

      1. Rural residents of Kilifi County
      
      2. University students at Pwani University
